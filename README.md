Hey! I'm Kade. I'm a Computer Science undergrad at Utah State University and cofounder of [Raydoc](https://raydoc.dev).

I used to be the lead flight software engineer for a student-led cubesat team for the [GASRATS](https://www.usu.edu/physics/gas/projects/gasrats) mission.

Previously, I've interned for [NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory](jpl.nasa.gov) as an intern software engineer on the [CADRE](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/cadre) mission and [BETA technologies](beta.team) as an intern embedded software engineer on [ALIA](https://www.beta.team/aircraft/).

I enjoy both Full-Stack and Embedded software engineering, which you can view examples of on my profile.
