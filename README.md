Hey! I'm Kade. I'm a Computer Engineering undergrad at Utah State University. I'm currently the lead flight software engineer for a student-led cubesat team for our current mission, [GASRATS](https://www.usu.edu/physics/gas/projects/gasrats).

Previously, I've interned for [NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory](jpl.nasa.gov) as an intern software engineer on the [CADRE](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/cadre) mission.
I've also interned for [BETA technologies](beta.team) as an intern embedded software engineer on [ALIA](https://www.beta.team/aircraft/).

I enjoy both Full-Stack and Embedded software engineering, which you can view examples of on my profile.
